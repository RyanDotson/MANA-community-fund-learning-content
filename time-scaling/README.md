# Time Scaling
This is an example showing how to scale objects in relation to time in the scene.  Using time in the scene is important to creating dynamic content and an easy way to may things more interactive & attractive.

The code to do this is in scene.tsx.  Everything else was mostly generated using `dcl init`.

# General Info
With this Dynamic Animation, we're demonstrating how to employ simple data binding to objects in your scene. Translation, rotation, and scale are all attributes you can bind to `state` properties.

Once you've got the CLI installed, to view the scene, you only need to switch to that directory and type `dcl preview` at the command prompt. It will make sure any dependencies are installed and then open the scene in a new browser tab automatically.
